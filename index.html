					<h2>SERVICES</h2>
					<p>Before we sign a contract or write a line of code our team will spend the necessary
						<br> time needed to understand your product vision.
						<br> The outcome of this scoping session is a proposal or high-level statement of work.
						<br> Based on your requirements, we can provide a complete offering or just the pieces
						<br> you need. </p>
